    "question": "Best sowing window for soybean in Vidarbha (Wardha, Nagpur)?",
    "answer": "For soybean in Vidarbha (Wardha, Nagpur), the ideal sowing window is usually from mid June to mid July, after receipt of at least 75–100 mm of rainfall and with good soil moisture. Delayed sowing beyond the last week of July often reduces yield. Use early-maturing varieties if sowing is delayed."

    "question": "Recommended seed rate and spacing for soybean?",
    "answer": "Soybean general recommendation: 30–35 kg/ha seed rate for bold seeded varieties, sown at 45 cm row spacing and 5–7 cm plant spacing (about 30–35 plants per metre row length). Maintain sowing depth of 3–4 cm only and use treated seed."

    "question": "Control of Yellow Mosaic Virus in Soybean?",
    "answer": "Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV) is transmitted by whiteflies. To control: (1) Use YMV-resistant varieties like JS-20-34 or JS-95-60. (2) Install yellow sticky traps (10-15/ha) to monitor whiteflies. (3) Spray Thiamethoxam 25 WG (100g/ha) or Acetamiprid 20 SP if vector population is high."

    "id": "mustard_fertilizer_black_soil",
    "tags": ["mustard", "fertilizer", "black soil", "nutrient", "npk"],
    "question": "Fertilizer recommendation for mustard on black soils?",
    "answer": "For mustard on medium black soils, a common blanket recommendation is around 60 kg N, 40 kg P2O5 and 20 kg K2O per hectare. Apply half N + full P and K as basal at sowing and remaining N at first irrigation. Also apply 20 kg S/ha (through gypsum) and micronutrients like zinc if deficiency is known."

  {
    "id": "mustard_aphids",
    "tags": ["mustard", "pest", "aphid", "insect", "sucking"],
    "question": "How to control aphids in mustard?",
    "answer": "Aphids cause severe damage to mustard. Management: (1) Late sown crops are more susceptible, so sow timely (Oct 15-30). (2) Spray Dimethoate 30 EC (1000 ml/ha) or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL (100 ml/ha) if 20-25 aphids/10 cm terminal shoot are observed. (3) Conserve natural enemies like Ladybird beetles."

    "question": "Major pests of groundnut and their basic management?",
    "answer": "Important groundnut pests include leaf miner, thrips, jassids and spodoptera. For IPM: use timely sowing, balanced fertilizer, removal of volunteer plants, install pheromone traps/light traps, and monitor 10–15 plants per field corner. If ETL is crossed, use recommended insecticides from local agri department, always avoiding spraying before rain or in high winds."

    "question": "Control of Tikka disease (Leaf Spot) in Groundnut?",
    "answer": "Tikka disease causes dark spots on leaves. Control: (1) Seed treatment with Carbendazim (2g/kg). (2) Spray Mancozeb 75 WP (2g/liter) or Hexaconazole 5 EC (1ml/liter) at 2-3 week intervals appearing of symptoms. (3) Remove infected plant debris."

    "question": "How can FPOs reduce post-harvest losses in oilseeds?",
    "answer": "To reduce post-harvest losses in oilseeds, FPOs should: (1) dry produce to safe moisture (8–9% for soybean, 7–8% for groundnut kernels), (2) use cleaned, graded bags, (3) store on wooden pallets away from walls, (4) ensure proper aeration and fumigation against storage pests, (5) digitize stock entries and stack-wise identification, and (6) avoid frequent handling which causes mechanical damage and oil loss."

    "question": "What is NMEO-OP and how does it help farmers?",
    "answer": "The National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) is a Government of India scheme to expand oil palm cultivation and reduce edible oil imports. It provides support for planting material, maintenance, intercropping, and price assurance to farmers. In your platform, it can be linked to advisories, credit schemes and performance-based incentives for oil palm growers."

    "tags": ["market", "price", "sell", "hold", "trend"],
    "question": "When is the best time to sell my oilseed crop?",
    "answer": "General advice: (1) Avoid panic selling immediately after harvest when arrivals are high and prices dip. (2) If you have storage, hold for 2-3 months. (3) Check the 'Market' tab for real-time mandi prices. (4) Sell if prices are 10-15% above MSP or if you have urgent cash needs."
